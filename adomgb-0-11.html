<H3>Companions and slaves</H3>

<b>0.11.1 Companions</b><p>

Companions are allies who will help the PC, to a point.  They can 
be obtained in several ways as outlined below.  Companions are often 
referred to as pets if they are animals.  One word of caution before 
attempting to create a powerful companion - they are fickle and will 
sometimes turn on the PC at the slightest provocation.  Some types 
of companions have a distinct personality and bear careful watching.  
A high charisma score is very helpful when ordering companions about.  
Most companions (not undead like an Emperor Lich) can be healed using 
any of the normal techniques - casting Heal and throwing potions of 
healing, for example.<p>

One problem that many players have with companions (or slaves) is that 
companions have a fixed speed.  This means that as the game progresses 
and the PC gains speed via wearables, the Athletics skill, eating 
quickling corpses, etc., companions become slower and slower relative 
to the PC.  This can become very annoying, with the PC forced to wait 
for companions to catch up.  This problem makes many players reluctant 
to rely too heavily on companions.<p>

Note also that companions cannot accompany PCs to D:50.  Companions 
can be <i>created</i> on D:50, but they cannot cross D:49.<p>


<b>0.11.1.1 Scrolls of Familiar Summoning</b><p>

These scrolls can be read to create a tame monster.  The monster 
created is dependent on the danger level of the dungeon level.  This 
means it is to the PC's advantage to read these in the most dangerous 
place possible.  In the early midgame, the best place is probably the 
Dwarven Halls, since almost anything can show up there.  Ancient 
karmic dragon, emperor lich and balor companions have been 
generated in the Dwarven Halls, for instance.<p>


<b>0.11.1.2 Figurines of wondrous power</b><p>

These miniature statues are a relatively new feature in ADOM, implemented 
by TB in response to players' requests for pet shops.  Figurines can also 
be found randomly in the dungeons.  They generate a monster when 'u'sed; 
the type of monster corresponds to the name (i.e. a jackal figurine of 
wondrous power).  If the figurine is blessed when 'u'sed, the monster 
produced is tame.  As with scrolls of familiar summoning, it is best to 
use them in a dangerous place.  The Small Cave is ideal, since newly 
generated monsters have roughly twice the experience level of the PC.<p>


<b>0.11.1.3 Taming monsters</b><p>

This is a specialty of bards, but any PC with the Music skill can try 
to tame monsters by placing a musical instrument in the tool slot and 
'u'sing it.  Most PCs are not very successful at this until the Music 
skill level is in the 90s.  The success rate is also dependent on the 
type of instrument used, with heavier instruments generally better 
than light ones. No PC can tame a pet if there are already three pets 
on a dungeon level. One or more pets must be led to a different level 
and left there. The PC can then return to tame more.<p>

Beggars can be made into companions by giving them gold and/or food.  
The most recent report (December 28th, 2001) required about 8000 gold 
pieces and 10 cooked lizards.<p>

Some monsters can be tamed by feeding them.  Cave lions and wild cats 
can be tamed by giving them rat or giant rat corpses.  This is very 
useful to remember if the PC wants the Ring of the Master Cat (see 
section 3.6).  Cave tigers can also be tamed, but they refuse to eat rat 
or giant rat corpses.  Instead, they like pieces of raw or fresh meat.  
Unfortunately, it takes more than five pieces of meat to completely tame 
them; this is out of reach for most PC's.  Wild cats (cave lions? cave 
tigers?) can also be tamed with fish, which can be obtained from water 
squares in the wilderness (see Section 0.4 re Survival).  Dogs can be 
tamed by giving them bones, which are readily available by killing 
skeletons.  This can be especially useful with blink dogs.  Tame a blink 
dog with bones, then get it involved in a fight.  The blink dog will 
summon more of his brethren, some of which will inevitably be killed.  
A blink dog corpse will eventually be generated, which grants teleport 
control when eaten.  This is particularly useful for lawful PCs.  Since 
blink dogs are lawful, killing them will wreak havoc on a lawful PC's 
alignment.<p>

<b>0.11.1.4 Hawkslayer</b><p>

The burly adventurer in the High Mountain Village will join a PC and act 
as a companion providing certain criteria are met: the PC must not be 
chaotic and the player (<i>not</i> the PC) must know a secret password 
("Iceberg"). The only way to learn the password in ADOM itself is 
drinking from pools, and many players are reluctant to do so. Some 
players may remember Hawkslayer from the computer RPG "Bard's Tale III". 
The password is the same in that game.  There is also an experience level 
requirement which is uncertain.  Level 25 PC's have successfully gotten 
Hawkslayer as a companion, so that stands as a maximum level for the 
requirement at the moment.<p>

Hawkslayer is not super-buff as companions go, but he is not bad.  <p>

On arriving at the HMV with a level 15 PC and using a blessed 
stethoscope on him, Hawkslayer was found to be:<p>

You examine Hawkslayer, the burly adventurer. Diagnosis: Level: 1, 
DV: 24, PV: 15, Hits: 355, Attacks: 1, Damage: 14-50. Speed: 120.<p>

A report from the Russian ADOM newsgroup on September 14th, 2000 
described a PC who was very careful with Hawkslayer to start, training 
him in the upper levels of the CoC, proceeding to the Big Room then 
deeper into the CoC until he was able to take on molochs and balors.  
Using a blessed stethoscope on him at that point gave the following:<p>

You examine Hawkslayer, the burly adventurer. Diagnosis: Level: 110, 
DV: 96, PV: 36, Hits: 805, Attacks: 11, Damage: 50-86. Speed:120.<p>

Quite impressive.<p>

Hawkslayer uses eternium arrows which can be retrieved for the PC's own use.<p>

It is possible to equip Hawkslayer with items in ADOM 1.0.0.  
If the PC drops certain equipment to the ground next to him he
will pick up the items and equip them.<p>

Unfortunately he will not wear body armor, but will equip boots, 
cloaks, gauntlets and shields.  Be very careful, however.  He will 
not equip these items after he is the PC's companion.  The items must 
simply be dropped next to him <i>before</i> giving him the secret password. 
This behavior will probably change in future versions of ADOM.<p>


<b>0.11.2 Slaves</b><p>

Slaves are the undead created to serve a necromancer PC.  They share 
some characteristics with companions.  They will fight against a 
necromancer PC's opponents up to the point where injuries cause them 
to panic and become afraid of further combat.  As with companions, a 
high Charisma score enables the necromancer to better control his 
slaves.  Note that traditional methods of healing damage undead rather 
than healing them.  The Bless spell also damages undead.  Undead in 
skeletal form (skeletons and skeletal warriors) can be healed by 
giving them bones.  Others must simply heal at their natural rate, 
which is often frustratingly slow.<p>

If a necromancer manages to survive to a high enough level to find 
quickling corpses, especially higher-level quickling corpses, most of 
the problems with undead vanish.  Quicklings are considered humanoid 
in ADOM and so their corpses can be animated with necromancy.  They 
are extremely fast (this also means the problem with slow companions 
vanishes, see section 0.11.1) and regenerate wounds at a phenomenal 
rate.  One particular quickling king skeletal warrior on record killed 
Nuurag-Vaarn, the Chaos Archmage, before the PC knew it had happened.<p>

Note that slaves are not subject to the experience level 50 limit as 
PCs are.  It is quite possible for slaves to reach experience level 
100 and higher.  Needless to say, they become formidable at those 
levels.<p>

One trick necromancers can use to create out of depth slaves is to 
exploit the properties of the small cave (check section 1.2.3 for a 
general explanation of how the small cave works).  In this scenario, 
a necromancer PC avoids entering the small cave at the beginning of 
the game, instead gaining early experience in the infinite dungeon or 
elsewhere.  As the game progresses, a source of invisibility will 
eventually be found.  It is rare for monsters that see invisible to 
be generated in the small cave.  At the same time, many are humanoid 
and their corpses are usable for necromancy.  If an experience level 
20 necromancer enters the small cave while invisible, he can reasonably 
expect to leave or descend into the unremarkable dungeon with a couple 
of level 35 - 40 slaves.  Very useful at that point in the game.<p>

Below is a chart that shows the choices a level 50 necromancer has for 
creating undead.  More detail will be added to this, indicating exactly 
what experience level is required for each undead type.  Note that the 
mana cost to create some undead will be higher for lower level PCs.<p>
