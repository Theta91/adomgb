<H3>The Cat Lord</H3>

The Cat Lord is found on D: 35 or D: 36.  The level message "This level somehow 
seems to be removed from the rest of the world." is generated upon entering the 
level.  Note that teleportation is not allowed on the level and ceiling traps 
may therefore be generated. If the PC has killed no cats, the PC may 'C'hat with 
the Cat Lord, in which case the following message is generated:  "The cat lord 
growls: "Thou hast respected the cat race. Thus I shall grant upon you this gift."  
The cat lord suddenly is gone. Nothing but a tiny ring is left of him."  In this 
case, congratulations are due.  The PC has the most powerful ring in the game, the 
artifact Ring of the Master Cat. It is enormously helpful in the end game, 
particularly because it grants +16 to Dexterity when the PC's dexterity is being 
destroyed by corruption.  The ring's full properties are listed below:<p>

-------------- ring of the master cat [+0,+5] {Dx+16} (+16 spd) ------------------<p>

When worn it modifies DV by +0 and PV by +5.<br>
When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points of<br>
damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1<br>
points of damage.<p>

It modifies your dexterity attribute by +16.<br>
It is very good at scoring critical hits in melee. It modifies your speed by +16.<br>
It makes Fate smile upon you.<br>
It grants the ability to see invisible things.<p>

Thanks to Grey for tips on fighting the Cat Lord:<p>

If the PC has killed cats, the Cat Lord will be hostile. He is a very difficult opponent, 
and becomes more difficult each time a cat is killed. Consequently he is worth many experience points. PCs desperate for experience may wish to forfeit the annoying quest and ring for the experience. The cat lord is vulnerable to poison, blinding, stunning, webs, paralysis, and humanoid slaying. However, he is fast, and moves as if he's wearing seven league boots. He also tends to be invisible, so the PC should be able to see invisible. If the PC wants to melee him, he must be disabled. Paralysis or stunning from the spells or wands tend to be shrugged off but will eventually work. He also shrugs Web, but will get stuck in the webs themselves. Arrows of darkness or thunder work well, as does throwing potions of blindness or cursed potions of invisibility. After disabling him start hammering hard with your favorite humanoid slayer till he falls. Keep a close eye in case he breaks out of the disability though, and keep a good healing source on standby. A few blasts from a wand of poison can help shorten the fight a bit.<p>

To missile him, get him stuck in webs and pepper him full of humanoid slaying ammo that has been dipped in poison. It can be best to lure him to a different level so you can teleport around freely. That way you can fill a corridor with webs and keep teleporting to each end of it, shooting at him as he keeps getting stuck.<p>

Bolt spells aren't greatly effective, though persistence may take him down eventually. Ball spells work beautifully though. You can even just disable him using one of the above methods and keep using a well charged wand of fireballs. He tends to panic fairly easily, in which case improved fireball can be used to great effect to take him down. In this case it's best to target the spell at a square next to him - if the center of the explosion is aimed straight at him then he'll stop panicking and pursue the PC. Aim next to him and he'll stay cowering in a corner while being slowly roasted to death.<p>

If you have killed cats and just want to avoid the fearsome cat lord then it may be worth luring him to another level to teleport around him, though it does mean having to put up with a round of attacks as you go up or down the stairs.<p>

Note the following bug: The game uses the kill list to determine if the PC has 
killed cats <i>upon entering</i> the Cat Lord's level.  This means the PC can slaughter 
cats indiscriminately on or below the Cat Lord's level after entering then receive 
the ring.<p>

Also see section 0.9.2 Cats for more on the subject.<p>
