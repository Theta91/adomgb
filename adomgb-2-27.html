<H3>The Bug-Infested Temple</H3>

100 PC deaths must be recorded in the adom.cnt file before entry will be allowed.  
There are no experience or level requirements for entry, either for the PC or 
in the HISCORE file.<p>

Some of the walls in the bug temple are diggable, but so many are not that it is 
not possible to make real progress.<p>

The bug temple has been beefed up considerably since 1.0.0 with the simple 
addition of the see invisible intrinsic for the bugs. Low (or even high) level 
spellcasters are no longer going to be able to finish this area easily.<p>

The rewards have been toned down: only three SoCRs, six PoUH, eight SoMM. The 
wand of fireballs has ten charges, the wand of teleportation has six charges.<p>

of the bug-infested temple.<p>

The bug-infested temple consists of two parts: the bug wilderness
(BUGWIL) and bug cave (BUGCAV). The wilderness part's outer limits are
scattered with greater claw bugs, that low-level spellcasters can bolt
to death (be very cautious!). Around the down staircase, there are eight 
killer bugs.<p>

Note that both greater claw bugs and killer bugs have high speed, breed,
have multiple attacks and bypass the PC's PV. This means that they are what
they're called - killers - in melee.<p>

Eating a greater claw bug corpse increases speed, gives +3 Dx and -6 Wi.
Eating a killer bug corpse also increases speed, gives +6 Dx and -12 Wi. 
The increases are no longer guaranteed in ADOM 1.1.1; the upper limit 
seems to be around 30.<p>

The 'g's are greater claw bugs and 'i's are killer bugs. ]'s represent
named marble statues. The numeral 1 represents secret doors. Teleportation 
doesn't work in BUGCAV.<p>

All the marble statues can be picked up and broken, like normal ones.
However, there's another meaning to them; reading. They're in place to
honor the prerelease testing group of version 1.0.0. Here's a
compilation of what they all mean and what you get from them. The
format for the list is: real name of tester - statue text -
reward for breaking the statue, besides rocks<p>

Thomas Biskup - "Bassuk Thimosp, Human wizard, who slaughtered the
fearful experience drainer of Prr'rlse." - nothing<p>

Stephen Mackey (Karkadinn) - "Matsep Cheyken, Troll Assassin, who
dedicated his life to harvesting the fish of Vinooresen." - barbed
trident of hunting (+2, 3d5+5)<p>

Markku Rikola - "Molkar Ur-Yack, the Orcish Elementalist, who unraveled
the secret of the legendary Ball of Hellfire, unfortunately slaughtering
himself in the process." - wand of fireballs (10 charges)<p>

Olli "Shader" Juhala - "Da Sehr Jhuala Liol, Dark Elven Beastfighter. He
was unexepctedly engulfed by the primal chaos of sorcerer coined." - 3
× scroll of chaos resistance<p>

Adrian Bancilhon - "Raidan Nichloban, Gray Elven Barbarian. Slow of
tongue, Slow of speech, The healing arts, He helped to teach." - 6 ×
potion of ultra healing<p>

Andy Williams - "Malawi Syldin, Dark Elven Ranger, who opened the lost
door of Mixyip Tor." - wand of door creation (100 charges)<p>

John Rowat - "Wor Janoth, Hurthling Mindcrafter. Explorer of the Lost
Volcano." - 8 × scroll of magic mapping<p>

Julian Day - "Yali Na Jud, Dark Elven Merchant, who collected the orbs
before being crushed by a thousand tons of rock." - padded elven chain
mail of resilience [+0, +9]<p>

Paul Nimmo - "Apul Omnim, the Male Human paladin. Finder of the
sightless path." - vigilant adamantium plate mail of travelling (-2, -4)
[-2, +11]<p>

Teemu Kokki - "Tuok Mekkei, Dwarven Ranger, who took part in the
expedition where the mysterious experience drainer was first
discovered." - 12 × winged quarrel of slaying<p>

Olivier Benard - "Dervi Albeiron, Human Paladin. He joined the forces of
Law against the foul beasts of G'ubs." - lawful 2HS of devastation (+3,
5d10+8) [-1, +0]<p>

Aaron Dutton - "Anora Tnod't, Troll Paladine. Lurker who was last to
observe a dungeon collapse caused by a writhing mass of primal chaos." -
lawful heavy club of devastation (+3, 5d10+8) [-1, +0]<p>

Conrad Brekke - "Candor Kerbek the Trap Eater. Dark Elf Assassin. Who
devised the devious deathmaze of the Assassin's Guild." - wand of
teleportation (6 charges)<p>

Joni Toivanen - "Janoi Netovi, the Human Barbarian, who was seriously
ill while others slaughtered gubs." - 12 × crystal of health<p>


Note that some of the rewards' stats may vary and that they are all
<i>cursed</i>. However, those potions of ultra healing, scrolls of magic
mapping and especially the scrolls of chaos resistance are a gift that
makes visiting the Bug Cave very worthwhile.<p>

There is one more statue, an "unfinished statue of an unquestionably
famous hero" in honor of Raymond Martineau. No reward for breaking him
down, though.<p>

Breaking the center statue and the statue ten squares west + one north 
stops the breeding of the bugs and results in an appropriate line in the 
accomplishment list at the end of the game.<p>
