<H3>High Mountain Village back door</H3>

This is the back door to the High Mountain Village, only available after the PC has 
entered the HMV through the Unremarkable Dungeon and departed through the secret 
stairway in the western wall.  See <A HREF="adomgb-1-2-3.html">section 1.2.3.2.2</A> and 
<A HREF="adomgb-2-21.html">section 2.21</A> for more about the HMV.<p>
