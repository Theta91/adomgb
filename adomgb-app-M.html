<H3>Appendix M - Wishing - suggestions and warnings</H3>

<HR size = "2"><p>

<b>Wishing suggestions:</b><p>

Top contenders:<p>

Items: amulet of life saving if pre-Khelavaster; red dragon scale mails especially if pre-ToEF; pairs of (guarantees plurality) seven league boots; scrolls of chaos resistance<p>

Skills: Concentration for magic; Find Weakness for melee<p>

Weapons: phase daggers (if no penetrating weapons are found); in general weapons are not a wise thing to use a wish on, there are plenty available in the game<p>

<b>Details:</b><p>

Wishes can yield any skill except for Alertness (which, when wished
for, increases Perception) and Healing (which, when wished for, heals the 
PC). Stats can also be wished for - although, wishing for 'learning' yields 
potions of learning - wish for 'knowledge' to increase Learning directly.
Appearance has to be wished for as 'beauty' and Perception as 'alertness'. 
The size of the stat increase depends on the stat: 7 points of Willpower 
is possible, the Strength bonus is usually around 3 and as high as 5 - 
which makes it more worthwhile to wish for potions of strength instead.<p>

A "manual of bridge building" can be wished for and the PC is able to learn 
the skill by reading it. Wishing for "manuals of bridge building" results 
in the strange flux message then Nothing Happens.<p>

If the PC wants to increase Learning, wishing for crystals of knowledge 
is better than wishing for potions of learning since blessed CoK's increase 
Learning by 1d2, you get three with one wish, and you can bless multiple 
CoK's with one potion of holy water, whereas you get two potions of learning, 
both of which take a potion of holy water to bless. With any decent kind of 
luck, the CoKs should bring at least 4, 5 or even 6 extra points to Learning.
However, CoKs will only raise Learning to 25.<p>

Wishing for the plural form of certain items results in a message:<p>

A voice in your mind booms...<br>
"*ONE* SHALL BE ENOUGH!"<br>
Your equipment feels heavier.<p>

Items in this category include amulets of life saving, girdles of giant 
strength and potions of gain attributes. Certain other items can only be 
obtained two at a time. Examples include potions of -stat-.<p>

Fish can only be wished for in its raw form, as "piece of fish meat" or "pieces of fish meat". 
Wishing for fried fish gives regular fish instead.<p>

<b>Wishing for speed:</b><p>

Stephen White has studied this in some detail and posted the following to RGRA on March 7th, 2002:<p>

"First I will mention that during the following testing I was
careful to look out for things like base modification of
speed due to burden or hunger status - I was always not even
burdened, and always of no specific hunger status, i.e. not
satiated or hungry, just normal.<p>

"OK, I just tested this out. I wished for "potions of boost speed"
10 times. I got only two potions twice, three potions six times,
and four potions twice, so we can assume the average is three
per wish.<p>

"I blessed them all, and drank them one at a time, allowing my
speed to return to normal between each one. The lowest speed
boost given was 21 points, which occured three times. The
highest was 47, acheived just once. The average overall was
30.8 speed points from one blessed potion.<p>

"This gives an overall total (assuming three potions from an
average wish, and average gain from each) of 92.4 points.<p>

"Then I tried wishing for "speed" directly, 12 times. I let my
speed return to normal after each, and took account of the
permanent increase of 1 point left over after the boost wears
off. The minimum boost I received was 150 points, the maximum
was 248 points. The overall average was 214.2 points.<p>

"So, this is pretty conclusive - it's best to wish for "speed"
directly. It's <i>possible</i> to gain more by using potions, if
you get 4 from your wish, and a decent gain from each, compared
to a quite unlucky wish for "speed", but in general wishing
for speed directly is almost guaranteed to give the bigger
increase."<p>

The original context of the thread was in regard to techniques useful when fighting Andor Drakon. High 
speed is also useful when fighting Srraxxarrakex, the emperor moloch, or other monsters the PC just doesn't 
want to be hit by.<p>

In the following table, the game's direct response is [in square brackets].<p>

<p>


Wishing for a raider lord and killing him before Tywat Pare assigns the quest results in no reward 
from Tywat Pare, other than the 300 gold pieces for the corpse. Furthermore, he will not assign 
the quest. If the PC gets the quest, wishes for a raider lord and kills him, Tywat Pare acknowledges 
the kill and gives the usual reward.<p>

Interestingly, wished-for ratling guardians are as immobile as those in the HMV and respond with the 
same message about guarding the city when 'C'hatted with.<p>

Wished-for ancient karmic wyrms are similarly confused. They are immobile, think they are Sharad-Waador 
and ask the PC to "Stand on the stairs... then we'll talk."<p>

A wished-for dwarven mystic always responds with the "Ye art doomed!" message and then disappears when 
'C'hatted with. The PC is not in fact doomed. See section 2.5.4.<p>

If the PC has received the puppy quest from the tiny girl, wishing for a cute dog and delivering it to 
her satisfies the quest requirement. If the PC has <i>not</i> received the quest, wishing for a cute dog 
may well result in one that is hostile. This causes an amusing scenario, to say the least, in Terinyo.<p>
