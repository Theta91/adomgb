<H3>Sharad-Waador's quest and the blue dragon caves</H3>

Sharad-Waador is an ancient karmic wyrm found in the unreal cave 
system branch off the CoC at D: 46 or D: 47.  He is found on level 
4.  He is nonhostile and will assign a quest to kill an ancient 
blue wyrm, Srraxxarrakex, who is his mortal enemy.  This is a 
difficult quest and is in no way necessary to finish the game.  
Part of the difficulty is the presence of Srraxxarrakex's children: 
many different blue dragons including ancient blue dragons which 
see invisible.  Blue dragons breathe lightning bolts, which will 
damage a PC without very good resistance or immunity as well as 
destroying items, both worn and in the pack.  There is no way to 
prevent the item destruction.  Items can be left in Sharad-Waador's 
room for safekeeping while on the quest.  Sharad-Waador does not 
move unless he is attacked or the PC reneges on the deal to take 
the quest.<p>

To receive the quest, the PC must first decide what equipment will 
be left behind, drop it, stand on the down staircase in 
Sharad-Waador's room, then 'C'hat with him.  This sequence of events 
is necessary because Sharad-Waador will not chat with the PC until 
the PC is on the down stairs, and after chatting with the PC demands 
that the PC descend immediately.  If the PC moves off the staircase 
at this point, Sharad-Waador becomes hostile.  A trick that can be 
used is leaving some of the PC's precious but 'might be needed' 
equipment <i>on</i> the stairway.  Sharad-Waador does not become 
hostile if the PC emerges from the blue dragon caves without moving 
from the stairway.  This provides a means of protecting very valuable 
equipment (such as scrolls of chaos resistance) that might be needed 
to save the PC's life. Despite the fact that Sharad-Waador does not 
see invisible, he will detect an invisible PC that emerges from the 
blue dragon caves without killing Srraxxarakex and become hostile if 
the PC moves from the stairs.<p>

The blue dragon caves consist of five levels, DL: 1-5.  In addition 
to the many varied blue dragons found in these caves, other nasty 
high level monsters may be found here, including chaos wizards and 
greater molochs, for example.  It is wise to have some means of 
dealing with greater molochs along, whether it is simply speed for 
running away, phase daggers or demon slayers.  High speed is 
virtually essential for killing Srraxxarrakex, as well.  Upon 
entering the fifth and final level of the caves, the following 
message is generated: "These ancient caves are covered with marks 
from huge reptiles... hundreds of such marks."  Srraxxarrakex will 
be found on this level.<p>

When the blue dragon caves were first implemented, there were 
complaints that the quest was impossible due to the item destruction.  
The amount of item destruction has been toned down a bit in more 
recent versions, and some players will actually scum these caves because  
killing the blue dragons generates large amounts of valuable equipment, 
sometimes including very valuable items such as scrolls of chaos 
resistance or rings of djinni summoning.<p>

The main reason for taking this quest however, is because Sharad-Waador 
rewards the PC with a huge pile of equipment for completing it.  Among 
this equipment, which generally does not contain anything remarkable, 
is the artifact dagger Needle.  Be very careful with this pile of 
equipment.  Needle is indistinguishable from ordinary daggers until it 
is identified.  It is best to have a blessed scroll of identify at the 
ready, to identify all the treasure the PC has taken from the blue 
dragon caves and the heap of stuff Sharad-Waador provides.  The junk can 
then be safely dropped without risking misplacing Needle.  When Needle 
is combined with its twin, the artifact dagger Sting, held by the 
Assassin Prince, they become the most powerful weapons in the game, at 
least in terms of raw to-hit and to-damage.  If a PC planning an ultra 
ending makes it this far, check section 2.11.3.1 and get the Filk quest 
from the Assassin Prince.  He can then be killed for Sting, if desired.<p>


<b>3.9.1 Srraxxarrakex</b><p>

Sraxxarrakex is a very powerful ancient blue wyrm, more powerful than 
any other ancient wyrm in the game.  He is, as might be expected, 
immune to shock.  One of the things that makes him so difficult to 
defeat is the fact that he naturally regenerates <i>and</i> casts powerful 
healing spells at the same time.  He has three attacks per round, so 
he can, for instance, breathe a lightning bolt, attack in melee, cast 
heal, while still getting natural regeneration <i>per round</i>.  His vital 
statistics:<p>

You examine Srraxxarrakex, the ancient blue wyrm. Diagnosis: Level: 1, 
DV: 60, PV: 40, Hits: 951, Attacks: 3, Damage: 20-76. Speed: 113.<p>

This means the PC must be capable of dealing massive amounts of damage 
quickly in order to defeat him.  He can be attacked in almost any way, 
including melee, missiles and magic.  He is of course vulnerable to 
dragon slaying missiles and melee weapons.<p>

Killing him is worth 1.6 million experience points.<p>
