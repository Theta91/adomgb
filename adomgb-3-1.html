<H3>The wall of flames</H3>

A wall of flames is encountered around D: 27.  Even if the PC has fire immunity, 
it cannot be passed without the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire.  The Orb is found 
in the Tower of Eternal Flames.  The wall of flames forces the player to retrieve 
it before proceeding.  See section 2.19 for more on the Tower of Eternal Flames.<p>

Note that the dungeon levels have an unusual arrangement at this point.  PCs 
will suddenly descend from D:24 to D:28 then ascend to D:27, D:26, D:25, then 
abruptly descend to D:29.  The wall of flames will be found in the middle of 
this sequence.<p>
