<H3>The Ruined City</H3>

<A HREF="adomgb-2-20-pic.html" target="blank">Click here</A> for a color map of the Ruined City.<p>

The Ruined City is the entrance to the Minotaur Maze, found in the 
far western central part of the wilderness map.<p>

Upon entering the wilderness square containing the ruined city, 
the following messages are generated:<p>

"As you advance into the ruins, you catch a short sight on some 
strange huge figure...<p>

With fluid motions it disappears into the ruins!<p>

Something seems to be waiting for you...<p>

You enter the ancient street of a long-dead and even 
longer-forgotten city.<p>

Various trees and shrubs have overgrown the monuments of a former
civilization. Strange unknown runes cover what remains of ancient 
palaces and buildings. Some forboding evil seems to lurk beneath 
the peace of death emanating from this strange place."<p>

A map of the ruined city reveals the strange huge figure to be a 
minotaur mazelord guarding the entrance to the minotaur maze hidden
behind a secret door:<p>

The minotaur mazelord guarding the entrance may or may not be hostile.
This may be alignment dependent (he seems to be always hostile to lawfuls), 
among other things and needs further investigation.<p>

There is a lower experience level limit in order to enter the Minotaur 
Maze, which seems to be experience level 22.  PCs with lower experience 
level are frightened away.  Likewise, there is an upper limit, which seems 
to be experience level 30.  The entrance to the Minotaur Maze is covered by 
an immovable stone block at this point.  Given the extremely nasty nature of 
the Minotaur Maze, the player is well advised to have the PC as experienced 
as possible before entering.<p>

The fact that it closes at PC experience level 30 is a <i>potential 
game-breaker</i>. If the PC drops a Chaos Orb in the Maze, then achieves 
experience level 30 outside, the game is over. Since the Chaos Orb is 
inside an inaccessible location, it will never be possible to open the 
passage to D:49. Note this same scenario can occur with the Pyramid (section 2.9).<p>


The objective is to find the Minotaur Emperor on level seven of 
the maze.  He holds the artifact Axe of the Minotaur Emperor.<p>


<b>2.20.1 The Minotaur Maze</b><p>

The mazes are very challenging, with false doors, false staircases, living 
walls, and a variety of minotaurs, including minotaur mazemasters, mazelords, 
magi and kings.  There is no random food generated in the mazes.  The 
minotaurs leave corpses, but they are not good to eat because they cause 
confusion.  Minotaurs may drop food when killed.  The mazes are heavily 
trapped.  It is wise to leave unnecessary equipment behind in order to prevent 
its destruction.  Since a climbing set is required to reach this portion of 
the map, climbing sets should be left behind. The down staircases may lead to 
false levels, which must be explored only to find that there are two (usually, 
less commonly one) up staircases with no down staircase.  Eventually the PC 
will find a true level six with a down staircase.<p>

Minotaurs often panic when 'severely wounded' and run away. This can be useful. 
Minotaurs only set off the traps in the mazes when in a state of panic. Once 
they reach the panicked state, they seem to set off every trap they cross. It 
is thus possible to use them strategically to clear a path for the PC.<p>

It is very obvious when the true bottom of the maze has been reached, because 
the following level message is generated:<p>

"You feel that this maze level is special in some respect... its convoluted
tunnels remind you of the brain tunnels of some sinister power lurking 
beneath the surface of the world and ready to strike at any intruders!"<p>

A representative layout of the final level of the minotaur maze is shown here:<p>

<b>2.20.1.1 The Minotaur Emperor</b><p>

The Minotaur Emperor is the central 'M' in the above map, surrounded by 
minotaur mages which are able to cast confusion. The mages are vulnerable to 
Stun Ray which stops their confusion attacks and leaves them vulnerable. The 
Minotaur Emperor is most easily killed with Web and missiles. Melee is ill-advised. 
When the Minotaur Emperor is killed, he drops several items which may vary. One example is:<p>

<table border=0>
<tr><td>blessed axe of the minotaur emperor (+12, 3d20+16) [-6, +4]<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[1200s]
<tr><td>uncursed potion of strength<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[4s]
<tr><td>uncursed potion of cure corruption<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[2s]
<tr><td>blessed potion of cure corruption<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[2s]
<tr><td>uncursed spellbook of Slow Monster<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[100s]
<tr><td>uncursed minotaur emperor corpse<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[240s]
<tr><td>uncursed topaz<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>[1s]
</table>
<p>

A blessed greater ID of the Axe of the Minotaur Emperor reveals:<p>

---------- blessed axe of the minotaur emperor (+12, 3d20+16) [-6, +4]---------<p>

It is an artifact.<p>

When worn it modifies DV by -6 and PV by +4.<br>
When used in melee combat it grants a +12 bonus to hit and causes 3d20+16<br>
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -12 bonus to hit and<br>
causes 3d16+6 points of damage.<p>

It is very good at scoring critical hits in melee.<br> 
It grants resistance to confusion attacks.<p>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>

Note the weight of the artifact axe.  The weight of the artifact, combined with 
the extraordinary difficulty of the mazes, makes most players completely ignore 
this location.  It is in no way necessary to complete the game.<p>
