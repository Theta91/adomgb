<H3>Darkforge</H3>

<A HREF="adomgb-2-18-pic.html" target="blank">Click here</A> for a color map of Darkforge.<p>

Darkforge is an important location in the game.  It is not a location for low level PCs, 
unless they have on demand controlled teleportation and a willingness to risk an instadeath 
from a single critical hit from a steel golem.<p>

The entrance to Darkforge is described as "A long and non-descript tunnel."  The first 
level of the dungeon is not particularly dangerous except for the presence of a steel 
golem guarding the down staircase.  Steel golems are very tough monsters for a mid-level 
PC.  If the PC has trouble with the steel golem guarding the down staircase, flee.  There 
are many more guarding Darkforge itself.  Upon entering Darkforge, the message "You smell 
the reek of sulphur, steel and oil." is generated.  The steel golems that guard Darkforge 
are unlife and thus immune to Mindcraft.  They are vulnerable to missiles of construct 
slaying, but it is almost unheard of to find enough such ammo to take them all out by 
this point in the game.  If the PC has on demand teleportation, it is wise to check the 
weapons cache before taking on the golems. There is a chance that a weapon of penetration 
or devastation will be found. They are vulnerable to Lightning, from the spell or wand, 
although it will take many castings or charges to kill all of them.  Steel golems will 
shrug off many lightning attacks, but can eventually be killed this way. They breathe fire, 
so both the PC and his equipment need to be protected from fire.  Many players will attempt 
Darkforge just before assaulting the Tower of Eternal Flames, in order to determine whether 
their PC has a good chance in the ToEF.<p>

The layout of the water squares in the pool room may help to keep golems or Kherab from 
attacking. If so, teleporting in and out is one way to attack them. Leaving the last group 
of golems near the Crown of Science alone will help to control monster generation in 
Darkforge. It has been observed that the steel horrors that are eventually generated tend 
to critically hit harder than the golems.<p>

Below is a map of Darkforge.  Note the caches of weapons, armor (it is possible to 
obtain artifact weapons and armor from these rooms) and gold, the room containing pools 
(which are not always generated in this pattern), the hidden room containing the Crown of 
Science (the lone [ ), the shortcut to the lower CoC and the nine forges.<p>

It is not wise to spend inordinate amounts of time in Darkforge - for example smithing.  
Darkforge has a higher than normal rate of background corruption.<p>


<b>2.18.1 Kherab</b><p>

Kherab is the dwarven artificer found in Darkforge.  He is presumably the creator of 
the steel golems, steel horrors and animated armors found in Darkforge.  He is quite 
tough, with hitpoints numbering in the hundreds and a powerful melee attack.  He is 
immune to fire, sees in Darkness, shrugs bolt spells quite well and has very fast 
regeneration. He is vulnerable to poison. He holds two items necessary for smithing: 
a hammer and an anvil. His hammer is an eternium warhammer. He also carries a crossbow 
and eternium quarrels. He is the source of two quests outlined below.<p>


<b>2.18.2 Kherab's quests and their rewards</b><p>

Kherab is the source of two chaotic quests.  The first is to kill Guth'Alak, the druid 
found in Terinyo.  This of course removes Guth'Alak as a source of potions of cure 
corruption and as the source of the Unicorn quest.  Depending on how it is accomplished, 
the entire village of Terinyo may become hostile as well.  If this happens, it may 
destroy any chance the PC has to obtain the TotRR.  The reward for this quest is the 
corrupting artifact shield of raw steel.  The second quest is to kill Thrundarr, the 
village elder in Dwarftown.  This can have all sorts of negative effects as well, 
including turning all of Dwarftown hostile and the killing of the demented ratling.  
The reward for this quest is the corrupting amulet of raw steel.<p>

The quest rewards are useful because they are artifacts.  They can be fed to the 
demented ratling, for instance.  The shield is the best in the game at [+18, +12] and 
To +8, but it cannot be used for the whole game due to its corrupting nature.  
However, it also grants fire immunity, so it is an option for PCs that need its 
properties to help with the ToEF. These "rewards" are not really rewards.  Kherab is 
an evil chaotic being and wants the PC dead.  Giving away corrupting artifacts is 
his way of trying to accomplish this.<p>
