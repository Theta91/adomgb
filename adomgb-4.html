<H3>Special Endings</H3><p>

<b>4.1 Andor Drakon</b><p>

Andor Drakon is the ElDeR cHaOs GoD, the source of all the trouble in 
Ancardia.  He resides on the ChAoS plane, which lies beyond the chaos 
gate.  Any PC who wants to attempt a special ending will have to face 
him.  The requirements for passing through the chaos gate vary according 
to alignment and whether the PC wants to attempt the normal chaos god 
ending or an ultra ending, and are detailed in the sections regarding 
the endings.<p>

It is a good idea to remove the Chaos artifacts necessary for gate passage 
immediately upon arrival on the ChAoS plane.  Furthermore, drop them.  
They are no longer needed and only serve to further corrupt the PC, which 
is going to happen rapidly anyway because of the corrupting nature of the 
ChAoS plane.  Read all scrolls of chaos resistance.  Drink all potions of 
cure corruption.<p>

Andor Drakon is, as might be imagined, a formidable enemy.  He is 
fast, with a speed of 217 the last time it was checked several gammas 
ago.  He is invisible.  He casts what are apparently death rays, has 
a corrupting melee attack in addition to the naturally corrupting chaos 
plane, paralyzes, summons (writhing masses of primal chaos are a favorite), 
casts darkness, teleports and drains stats and power points at a fearsome 
rate.<p>

His speed was gleaned from the Monster Memory which is otherwise not 
helpful, stating that he is beyond description.  He also seems to be 
immune to the effects of a blessed stethoscope.<p>

How to deal with him?  Have a massively powerful melee attack.  Drink 
all stat boosting potions prior to gate entry.  Be very, very fast, 
the faster the better, preferably speed should be intrinsically above 
200 and boosted above 400.  Have excellent PV and DV.  Have every 
resistance possible.  If the PC is not paralyzation resistant, an 
amulet of free action (or the Boots of the Divine Messenger, for 
instance) is essential.  A light source is essential.  He is vulnerable 
to demon and humanoid slaying weapons and ammo.  If the PC sticks with 
missiles, Andor Drakon cannot corrupt by touch, paralyze or drain stats. 
If the PC is out of direct line his Death Rays cannot be used.<p>

He has been killed in many different ways, including using the Acid Ball 
spell in a previous gamma version of the game. Relying on spells on the 
ChAoS plane is not currently recommended, since Andor Drakon now drains 
PP very rapidly and claims that using magic strengthens him. In practice 
casting spells seems to make him faster. A wand of fireballs or crystals 
of fire are handy for removing the hordes of writhing masses of primal 
chaos he will probably summon.<p>

Chaotics should avoid prayer on the ChAoS plane. It causes greater balors 
to be summoned.<p>

If a PC has much trouble on D: 50, it does not bode well as far as 
defeating Andor Drakon goes. He often defeats PCs who have <i>no</i> 
trouble on D: 50 (but are perhaps not as spoiled as those reading this).<p>

<b>4.2 The Chaos God ending</b><p>

The Chaos God ending was the first special ending available in ADOM, as of gamma 6 (?).
Today it has become kind of old-fashioned.  Victory posts with "ordinary" Chaos Gods 
are few and far between.  One reason it has fallen out of favor is because the future 
history of the PC after winning is bleak: after going to all the trouble necessary to 
even meet, much less defeat Andor Drakon, the PC revels in his glory for some time but 
is ultimately vanquished by a Champion of Law.  Still, it is the only means of 
accessing a special ending if Khelavaster cannot be saved, which is very difficult.  
It is also the only way to achieve a special ending with a pure chaotic: a PC that 
starts chaotic and stays that way for the entire game.  That in itself is quite an 
accomplishment.<p>


<b>4.2.1 Requirements</b><p>

In order to achieve the Chaos God ending the PC must meet several requirements.  These 
are checked during passage through the Chaos Gate.  He must be C-.  He must be a crowned 
Champion of Chaos.  He must be extremely corrupted (the game will inform you when the PC 
is extremely corrupted).  If these criteria are not met, the PC is shredded to pieces by 
any of several guardians or the millions of Chaos denizens Andor Drakon has collected 
(the exact guardian who kills the PC will have to wait for further testing, however, 
from memory, it is something like multi-tentacled horrors of unspeakable might check C- 
alignment, a chaos knight checks for crowned Champion of Chaos and says "I bow before 
thee, my lord!" if the requirement is met and the millions of Chaos denizens check the 
requirement for extremely corrupted; a successful check causes them to chant "One of us!  
One of us!").  Further, the PC must have the Chaos Trinity properly equipped: wear the 
Crown and Medal of Chaos, wield the Sceptre of Chaos in the right hand, leave the left 
hand empty.  If this requirement is not met, Andor Drakon blasts the PC to oblivion.  
A successful check results in a message from Andor Drakon along the lines of "You seem 
to be wearing the insignia correctly.  iT wIlL bE a PlEaSuRe To ShReD yOu In MeLeE!"  
If all of this is met, the PC winds up on the ChAoS plane to face Andor Drakon. Despite 
the fact that wielding the Sceptre of Chaos is required for Gate entry, in ADOM 1.1.1 
it is not necessary for the PC to be wielding it when Andor Drakon is killed (unlike 
the TotRR in the ultra endings below). Since it is a corrupting artifact, it may be 
wise to discard it immediately upon arrival on the ChAoS plane.<p>


<b>4.3 Ultra endings</b><p>

The Ultra endings were available as of gamma ten.  In this gamma, the restriction on 
Chaos Gate entry for chaotics only was removed.  However, the PC needs to have a 
mythical and long searched-for weapon - the Trident of the Red Rooster (TotRR).  The 
steps necessary to obtain it are listed below.<p>

All PCs attempting an Ultra ending 
must procure the Crown of Chaos and Medal of Chaos. In order to receive the first quest 
for the Medal of Chaos from Gaab'Baay the PC must be at some flavor of chaotic 
alignment. There are six quests total, the first of which is to "satisfy the mutated 
one" which refers to completing the demented ratling's demand for six artifacts.  The 
demented ratling will also only talk to chaotics. The demented ratling reveals the 
secret of the Stone Circle, where Keriax, the multi-headed chaos dragon who holds the 
Crown of Chaos resides. After receiving Gaab'Baay's first quest, the PC is free to 
change alignment. If this is planned, it should be done as soon as practical, since 
changing alignment away from chaotic becomes more difficult as the PC becomes more 
experienced. The Stone Circle can be entered regardless of alignment. Remember the PC 
must change back to at least some flavor of neutral alignment in order to retrieve the 
TotRR.  Khelavaster will not summon the TotRR for chaotics.<p>

All of the above has another implication - the PC cannot be crowned until the first quest 
for the Medal of Chaos (or the TotRR itself, if an Ultimate Chaos God ending is planned) 
is obtained. Fallen champions will never receive the TotRR nor survive passage through 
the Chaos gate, so the nice benefits of crowning must be deferred until Gaab'Baay's first 
quest or the TotRR are obtained, depending on the ending planned.<p>


<b>4.3.1 The Trident of the Red Rooster</b><p>

The Trident of the Red Rooster is the ultimate weapon available in ADOM.  Its 
characteristics can be found in Appendix L, but more importantly, it allows passage 
through the Chaos Gate regardless of alignment.  Retrieving it is a lengthy process 
outlined below.<p>


<b>4.3.1.1 The Filk quest</b><p>

The Filk quest is available from the Assassin Prince, on behalf of the Mad Minstrel, 
once three requirements are met.  They are: the PC is at least experience level 45, the 
PC has successfully taken Sharad-Waador's quest and slain Srraxxarrakex and the PC has 
in his possession the artifact dagger Needle which is one of the rewards Sharad-Waador 
provides for killing Srraxxarrakex.  After receiving the quest, the PC may elect to kill 
the Assassin Prince since he carries Needle's companion dagger Sting.  Dual-wielded, 
they are enormously powerful.  The object of the quest is to kill Filk, a named quickling 
bard.<p>

The Assassin Prince gives some cryptic hints provided by the Mad Minstrel about Filk's 
location.  They mean that Filk can be found on the level of the ID corresponding to the 
number of first-killed monsters killed.  Note that this number can change as the quest 
proceeds.  As a quickling, he is obviously fast, but Filk is the fastest of them all 
with a speed of 1500.  When attacking Filk, note two things: he has the highest DV of 
any monster in the game at 500 but a PV of zero.  Needless to say he is difficult to hit.  
However, once he is hit he is easily killed.  He also shares the properties of karmics, 
although he is not named as such.  Use missiles, wands, spells, mindcraft or companions 
to kill him.<p>


<b>4.3.1.2 The Mad Minstrel</b><p>

After the Filk quest is completed, the PC should visit the Mad Minstrel.  He will 
provide access to and information about the location of the Scintillating Cave (found 
in the western part of the wilderness south of the RotHK caves very close to the Ruined 
City).<p>


<b>4.3.1.3 The Scintillating Cave</b><p>

The Scintillating Cave consists of eight cavernous levels.  As one of the last places 
the PC will visit, it is dangerous and has a high generation rate featuring very 
dangerous monsters.  Ancient Karmic Dragons, Greater Molochs and Emperor Lichs are 
common.  It is best to simply get to the down staircases as quickly as possible unless 
the PC is an absolute walking tank by this time (which some aspiring to Ultra endings 
are).  The objective is to find the down staircase to the lair of the Emperor Moloch.<p>


<b>4.3.1.3.1 The Emperor Moloch</b><p>

By this time the PC has probably faced Greater Molochs and can imagine what the Emperor 
Moloch will be like. Extraordinary PV, not much DV, slow and hits like a ton of bricks.  
In addition, the level he resides on is massively corrupting. He must be killed quickly 
or lured off the level. He is vulnerable to phase daggers, ball spells, high 
effectivity bolt spells, demon slaying missiles including the rune-covered trident 
(although it is not guaranteed to return) and greater telekinetic blast. The twin 
daggers are not effective. When killed, he drops two guaranteed items: the crumpled 
scroll and a moloch armor weighing 15000 stones(!). The crumpled scroll is the key to 
the TotRR. The crumpled scroll is not an artifact and just as susceptible as any scroll 
to damage. The PC should read it as soon as possible. It is then possible to recreate it 
with a magical writing set.<p>


<b>4.3.1.4 Khelavaster in Terinyo</b><p>

At this stage in the game Khelavaster can be found in Terinyo.  He is invisible.  When 
given the crumpled scroll, he will summon the TotRR.  Remember the PC must be of 
neutral or lawful alignment.<p>


<b>4.3.2 The Avatar of Order ending</b><p>

To finish this ending the following requirements must be met: the PC enters the Chaos 
Gate as a crowned L+ Champion of Law wearing the Crown and Medal of Chaos and wielding the 
TotRR.  The PC must not be intrinsically doomed or cursed other than due to wearing the 
Chaos artifacts.  There is no corruption requirement.  Kill Andor Drakon while wielding 
the TotRR.  If the TotRR is not wielded when Andor Drakon dies, the ChAoS energies released by his death overwhelm the PC, turning him into a miserable ChAoS wretch. Avoid this. ;-) Note that it is possible for a prospective Avatar of Order to become a fallen champion on the ChAoS plane, kill Andor Drakon while wielding the TotRR, and instead become an Avatar of his current alignment, despite not being crowned. This is one way around the corruption requirement for the Avatar of Balance and UCG endings. However, the PC must be able to change alignment on the ChAoS plane while fighting Andor Drakon, easier said than done.<p>


<b>4.3.3 The Avatar of Balance ending</b><p>

To finish this ending the following requirements must be met: the PC enters the Chaos 
Gate as a crowned N= Champion of Balance wearing the Crown and Medal of Chaos and wielding 
the TotRR.  The PC must not be intrinsically doomed or cursed other than due to wearing 
the Chaos artifacts.  The PC must be extremely corrupted (the game will inform you when 
the PC is extremely corrupted).  Kill Andor Drakon while wielding the TotRR. If the TotRR is not wielded when Andor Drakon dies, the ChAoS energies released by his death overwhelm the PC, turning him into a miserable ChAoS wretch. Avoid this. ;-)<p>


<b>4.3.4 The Ultimate Chaos God ending</b><p>

To finish this ending the following requirements must be met: the PC enters the Chaos 
Gate as a crowned C- Champion of Chaos wearing the Crown and Medal of Chaos and wielding 
the TotRR.  The PC must not be intrinsically doomed or cursed other than due to wearing 
the Chaos artifacts.  The PC must be extremely corrupted (the game will inform you when 
the PC is extremely corrupted).  Kill Andor Drakon while wielding the TotRR.<p>
