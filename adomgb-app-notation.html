<H3>Notation for item appendices</H3>

<b>
Most items are listed with the "common" group, then the "noble" group
(expensive metals and the like), then artifacts. + denotes an artifact
which is obtained through game plot, * an artifact which is obtained
randomly. H(+x, mdn) denotes hand-to-hand damage, M() missile damage.
Effect abilities conferred are abbreviated. +Tele means "grants
teleportation", -Fire means "fire resistance", =Fire (two lines, get it?) means
"fire immunity". Slaying powers are denoted by !. Most items are
listed with their unidentified appearance. If this
appearance is shown in (), that means the appearance is not always the
same, but the "associated" or "most common" appearance. For expendable
magical items (wands, scrolls etc, not worn equipment) imagine that ALL
appearances are listed in (). Not everything is filled in.
ALL STATISTICS ARE "BASE" NUMBERS AND CAN BE ADJUSTED UP OR DOWN AS THE
ITEM APPEARS. </b>

As always, corrections are invited.
