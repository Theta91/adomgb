[1] Scrolls of defense and protection affect only the following worn items in this order: armor, 
helmet, cloak, boots, gauntlets, girdle, bracers. Cursed SoD and SoP always decrease DV or PV by 
one. Blessed SoD and SoP may increase items with low DV or PV by two or three points.<p>

All scrolls weigh 2s.<p>

<p>Scrolls can be written if the PC is literate, has seen an example of the scroll, has 
a magical writing set and a blank scroll to write on.Blank scrolls can be found in the 
dungeons (usually an unlabeled scroll, although this is not guaranteed), or they can be 
created by dipping other scrolls into <i>normal</i> water - not holy water or unholy water.
Be aware that the cost for writing scrolls of chaos resistance is high - there is a 
permanent loss of two or three mana points for <i>wizards</i>, apparently depending on the 
blessed vs uncursed status of the magical writing set.The mana cost for non-wizards is 
significantly higher, ten mana points is typical.In addition, any combination of a 
blessed MWS with an uncursed blank scroll or an uncursed MWS with a blessed or uncursed 
blank scroll will result in a loss of hitpoints.This loss ranged from 70 to 145 HP with 
a WADOMF'd experience level one wizard PC.The HP loss may go down with increasing 
experience level for wizards, but this has not been tested.The HP consequences for 
non-wizards may be more dramatic (i.e. deadly).<p>

Writing other scrolls does not have such drastic consequences, though the exact effects 
have yet to be worked out.<p>
