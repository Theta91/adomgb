<H3>The Wilderness</H3>

<A HREF="adomgb-1-2-5-pic.html" target="blank">Click here</A> for a color map of the wilderness.<p>

The wilderness is the overland map of the Drakalor Chain.  It is often 
regarded as a curse by new players, whose PC's are killed in wilderness 
encounters and have difficulty keeping their PCs fed during treks across 
the wilderness.  Advanced players with PCs who are well equipped to deal 
with the wilderness regard it as a wonderful resource.<p>

The Survival skill can be useful for lengthy stays in the wilderness, but 
note that applying it wastes a lot of game time.<p>


<b>1.2.5.1 Why start the game in the Wilderness?</b><p>

Many players will start the game in the wilderness, at least for the 
first kill, because the first monster killed can be controlled according 
to what type of wilderness square generates an encounter.<p>


<b>1.2.5.2 Strategy and problems in the wilderness</b><p>

In order to avoid wasting too much time in the wilderness (e.g. because 
of the dreaded 90 day limit), it is good to know how long it actually 
takes to do things in the wilderness.<p>

All times are approximate since there are slight variations of some 
minutes. It is also the case that without apparent reason walking times 
are sometimes doubled.  This can happen for any terrain type and might be 
a bug.  Being burdened or strained does not cause this and has marginal, 
if any, effect on movement time in the wilderness.<p>
<table border=0>
<tr><td>Action<td>Time required
<tr><td>changing body armor<td>0 min
<tr><td>changing other parts of equipment<td>60 min
<tr><td>resting<td>60 min
<tr><td>moving onto a plains, road, water, or special (dungeon entrance and the like) square<td>60 min
<tr><td>moving onto a hills square<td>90 min
<tr><td>moving onto a forest square<td>120 min
<tr><td>moving onto a swamp square<td>180 min
<tr><td>moving onto a mountain square (provided you own a climbing set)<td>300 min
<tr><td>applying Survival (Rangers of level 1-5 and non-Rangers)<td>240 min
<tr><td>applying Survival (Rangers of level 6-50)<td>120 min
</table>
<p>
Note that the swimming skill and water breathing intrinsic have no effect 
on the time needed to move onto a water square.  Likewise, the climbing skill 
and the blessed/uncursed/cursed status of a climbing set have no effect on 
the time needed to move onto a mountain square.<p>

Note that a climbing set is required to move onto mountains.  It is important 
to know the status of a climbing set, in particular making sure it is not 
cursed.  A cursed climbing set will fail at the most inopportune moment.  
At a minimum, the resulting slip while mountaineering will cause extensive 
equipment destruction.  It is often fatal.  The blessed vs uncursed status 
seems to have little or no effect.<p>

<b>1.2.5.3 The Survival skill</b><p>

Successfully applying the Survival skill when not bloated increases the 
satiation value of the PC by about 100 (equivalent to 1/5 large ration, see 
Appendix G). This is roughly tripled for Rangers of level 6 or above. These 
values hold for both water and land squares.<p>

If the PC is already bloated, his satiation value isn't increased. Instead, 
he gathers plant seeds (on land squares) or goes fishing (on water squares). 
The amount of seeds gathered does not depend on terrain type or skill value 
and averages at about 5.2. For Rangers of level 6 or above, the average 
number of seeds gathered is about 16.7.<p>

When fishing is successful, the PC obtains exactly one piece of fish meat.<p>

The chances of success when applying the Survival skill depend on skill value, 
terrain type and the Ranger level 6 class power. The following success rates 
were measured by applying the Survival skill 100 times, with a skill value of 
100. The "normal" column applies to non-Rangers and Rangers of level 1-5, the 
"high" column to Rangers of level 6-50.<p>
