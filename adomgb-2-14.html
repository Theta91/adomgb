<H3>Khelavaster</H3>

Khelavaster is the sage who revealed the prophecy about the coming of chaos.  
He entered the dungeons in the Drakalor Chain never to be seen again.  The 
PC eventually encounters him below Dwarftown, after the Dwarven Halls or 
Animated Forest, generally on D: 16.  By this time Khelavaster is mortally 
wounded and surrounded by chaos servants.<p>

<b>2.14.1 Saving Khelavaster</b><p>

At this time the PC must make a choice about saving Khelavaster.  He is on 
the down staircase and it is impossible to descend further without saving 
him or allowing him to die.  It is however, possible to ascend, leaving the 
level in its state as found for an indefinite period of time.  He can only 
be saved by giving him an amulet of life saving <i>before</i> 'C'hatting 
with him. There is no guaranteed way to obtain an amulet of life saving and 
they are very rare items. If the player is determined to attempt an ultra 
ending, Khelavaster must be saved since he is the only one capable of 
summoning the Trident of the Red Rooster.<p>

Common methods of attempting to get an amulet of life saving include staying 
in the infinite dungeon until one is generated or draining every pool the PC 
has found in the hopes of obtaining a wish.  A ring of djinni summoning may 
also be generated in the infinite dungeon, which provides a wish when blessed.<p>

There is a well known (or is the word notorious?) bug in the game that 
occasionally causes an unrecoverable crash when the PC 'C'hats with Khelavaster. 
Needless to say, this can be disappointing, especially if the player's PC has 
an amulet of life saving. <b><i>Make a backup before 'C'hatting with Khelavaster.</i></b>
This is not savescumming. It is avoiding a known fatal bug in the game.<p>

<b>2.14.2 Khelavaster's gifts</b><p>

In any case, Khelavaster reveals a bit about the plot of the game including 
the existence of the chaos orbs and their general locations.  He also leaves 
some equipment for the PC.  The equipment he leaves depends on whether he is 
saved or dies.  The equipment is guaranteed, but if he is allowed to die the 
exact status varies.  Three examples are shown below.<p>

cursed robe [+0, +1]<br>
uncursed boots of sneakiness [+0, +2] {Dx +2}<br>
blessed amulet of protection +2<br>
uncursed eternium dagger (+0, 2d4+7)<br>
cursed wand of digging (4 charges)<br>
cursed potion of invisibility<br>
474 gold pieces<p>

uncursed robe [+0, +1]<br>
uncursed boots of sneakiness [+0, +0] {Dx+5}<br>
uncursed amulet of protection +2<br>
uncursed eternium dagger (+1, 2d4+7)<br>
uncursed wand of digging (4 charges)<br>
uncursed potion of invisibility<br>
271 gold pieces<p>

uncursed robe [+0, +1]<br>
uncursed boots of sneakiness [+0, +0] {Dx+2}<br>
uncursed amulet of protection +2<br>
cursed eternium dagger (+0, 2d4+7)<br>
uncursed wand of digging (4 charges)<br>
cursed potion of invisibility<br>
406 gold pieces<p>


If Khelavaster is saved, the equipment he leaves is (almost) exactly the same every time:<p>

blessed eternium dagger (+0, 2d4+7)<br>
blessed wand of digging (8 charges)<br>
heap of 4 blessed potions of ultra healing<br>
heap of 6 blessed scrolls of chaos resistance<br>
blessed spellbook of Identify<br>
blessed spellbook of Teleportation<p>

Note the quality of this equipment.  The six blessed scrolls of chaos resistance 
alone are roughly equal to two wishes.  Thus it is definitely worth spending a 
wish to obtain an amulet of life saving for Khelavaster.<p>

The exact stats of the eternium dagger may vary.  One report revealed that the 
dagger may be as good as (+0, 2d4+10).<p>

If Khelavaster is saved, he reappears in invisible form in Terinyo late in the 
game.  If the PC gives him the crumpled scroll, obtained by killing the Emperor 
Moloch, he will summon the TotRR for non-chaotics.  There is apparently an 
experience level requirement in order for Khelavaster to appear in Terinyo, but 
the PC does not need to have the crumpled scroll.<p>
