<H3>D: 50</H3>

<A HREF = "adomgb-3-13-pic.html" target = "blank">Click here</A> for a color map of D: 50.<p>

Level 50 of the Caverns of Chaos is the final battleground for those not 
attempting an ultra ending.  It is appropriately challenging.  The Mana 
Temple will have provided an idea of what CoC 50 will be like for PCs that 
make it this far.<p>

The level layout on the left side of the level is as follows:<p>
<pre>
############                             #######

The numeral 1 represents secret doors.<p>

The right side of the level is random.  Note the dungeon features.  The & 
symbols in this map do not represent demons but rather levers.  These control 
the state of the Chaos Gate, represented by the 8 in the large central room.  
These features cannot be seen in the color map.<p>

Note that all of the & symbols in the color map <i>do</i> represent balors - there 
are balors standing on the levers.<p>

There are two basic ways to finish CoC 50: The object of the level is to 
'h'andle both of the levers, thus closing the Chaos Gate and ending the 
incursion of chaos into Ancardia.  This can initially be accomplished by 
clearing the northern and southern corridors and 'h'andling the levers.  
However, the balors on CoC 50 are intelligent enough to reopen the gate. 
To ensure that the levers remain in their closed position, the PC has 
two choices: ensure the levers remain in their closed position forever, 
or make sure the balors on D:50 are dead.<p>

A third alternative is available for those PCs who aspire to special 
endings, which require Chaos Gate entry. Much of the combat on D: 50 can be 
bypassed as soon as it is possible to teleport to the location of the Chaos 
Gate. In order to do this, Fistanarius, the greater balor, must move from 
his position on top of the Chaos Gate. See section 4 Special Endings, for 
more about the (extensive) requirements for attempting a special ending.<p>


<b>Wands of destruction ending</b><p>

One relatively easy way to finish CoC 50 is to use wands of destruction.  
This, and the variation using wands of door creation + monster creation 
below, require substantially less combat than a traditional ending.  The 
level is <i>usually</i> diggable, so it is <i>usually</i> possible to 
tunnel into the northern and southern corridors and clear them.  If not, 
the PC is in for some more work. Remember they are closed by secret 
doors.  During this, some of the intelligent monsters may sense what is 
happening - ghost lords may pass through the walls, balors may teleport in.  
When both corridors are cleared, 'h'andle one of the levers to close it.  
Zap a wand of destruction to destroy it in its closed state. This will open 
the walls to the large central room and make all of those monsters pursue 
the PC.  Teleport to the other lever, 'h'andle it to close it and zap a 
wand of destruction to destroy it.  Teleport to the up staircase and leave.  
You've won.  Here is an example of what the level might look like after 
doing this:<p>
<pre>

Note most of the balors, but not Fistanarius, have teleported to search for 
the PC.  The chaos mutants in the center, the greater chaos servants in the 
central corridor, the writhing masses of primal chaos and most of the ghost 
lords have not even moved.<p>

<b>Wands of door creation + monster creation ending</b><p>

This is a variation on the above technique.  It is somewhat safer in that the 
big room never has to be opened at all, but both wands of door creation with 
at least six total charges and a wand of monster creation with two charges 
are required.<p>

This method starts with the same approach as outlined above - clear the 
northern and southern corridors after entering them by digging. Zap a wand of 
door creation twice to almost enclose one of the levers.  Handle the lever to 
close it. Zap a wand of monster creation to create a monster on the closed 
lever to prevent balors from teleporting to that space. Zap a wand of door 
creation to trap the monster on that square. Teleport to the other lever and 
repeat. Teleport to the stairs and leave.<p>

This method has some problems, as does the wands of destruction ending above.  
Regardless, they are much, much easier than the alternative of killing the 
balors on the level. First, some monsters will open doors, so it may be 
necessary to keep zapping, killing the monster and repeating until something 
suitable is generated. Locking the door will solve this problem if the PC has 
an appropriate key, which he should by this time. Second, the PC must be quick, 
which is why teleportation is recommended. It is quite likely that the balors 
will start teleporting to investigate the levers, and they are quite capable 
of opening the doors or smashing them if locked, killing the monster standing 
on the lever and reactivating the lever. Third is simply a philosophical 
problem. The PC has not really fulfilled the requirements for winning, but is 
taking advantage of the fact that the level will remain frozen after he leaves.  
Nonetheless, the game counts this as a win.<p>
