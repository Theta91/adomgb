<H3>What kind of character is good for each starsign?</H3>

A) Raven<p>

The +10 to speed is good for all PCs.  It can save the life of low level 
PCs who need to run away from a monster they can't handle.  The "messengers
will reach you faster" refers to the delivery of the rune-covered trident, 
which happens faster for those born in this month, a nice bonus.  The "harder 
to trick by deceptions" grants resistance to confusion attacks by dopplegangers.
The stronger companions characteristic makes this month excellent for bards.<p>

B) Book <p>

Lawful tendencies is a weak effect.  One free skill increase each level helps 
all PCs, especially those with low learning.  Increased chance to learn spells 
means borderline cases have a better chance.  This is not the ideal month for 
a wizard - they are already great at learning spells.  More suited to elven 
fighting classes or a dwarvish paladin. <p>

C) Wand <p>

Here we have the sign for a neutral wizard.  Gray elven wizards are ideal 
with their naturally high mana and neutral alignment.  They are somewhat 
difficult to keep alive in the early game but become enormously powerful in 
the mid- and endgame.<p>

D) Unicorn <p>

Generic sign with resistance to corruption.  Pretty attractive for any PC 
going for an ultra ending, especially an aspiring Avatar of Order.  The fact 
that lawful alignment is difficult to change means such a PC can commit a 
few chaotic acts and get away with it without becoming a fallen champion.  
Also nice for an aspiring (ultimate) chaos god, since crowned chaotics are 
corrupted more rapidly than others.<p>

E) Salamander <p>

Very attractive for elementalists, who rely on a lot of fire magic.  Not 
half bad for a necromancer who finds some fire-based spellbooks, either.  
Necromancers need that +3 to Mana.<p>

F) Dragon <p>

Fighters.  The +1 to toughness is not significant - that is within the 
variability for the stat for identical race/class PCs.  The -3 to willpower 
is significant and makes this unattractive for those who need it in the early 
game - wizards, mindcrafters.  Not a bad month for paladins with both weapon 
and combat magic costs reduced.<p>

G) Sword <p>

Learning bonus is insignificant, although it can push a PC from illiterate to 
literate.  The 20% reduction in cost to train melee weapon skills makes this 
attractive for a PC that really wants to become super-proficient with a weapon.  
Not a bad choice for rangers who start the game dual wielding swords.<p>

H) Falcon <p>

Grants the survival skill to any character. This skill is generally considered 
as being of little use (see section 0.4). The willpower bonus is somewhat 
useful for spellcasters and mindcrafters, although better starsigns exist for 
those classes. The charisma bonus is of little significance for any character,
with the possible exception of bards, necromancers and male merchants. The 
free talent is good for all PCs, especially for gnomish and hurthling bards, 
as it guarantees them both a very useful heir gift and the possibility to go 
for the treasure hunter talent.<p>

I) Cup <p>

Another sign for wizards.  Higher learning to start and the 10% reduction to 
gain a level means they advance rapidly, which is very helpful in keeping them 
alive at low level.  The 20% effectivity increase in learning spells also helps 
keep them alive in the early game, while the player has not had time to raise 
their learning score.<p>

J) Candle <p>

This can be an unbelievable sign for trolls.  They heal rapidly anyway, but those 
born in this month almost don't need the Healing skill!  Almost.  Get it and they 
seem to have natural regeneration.  Playing a trollish healer born in this month 
is almost cheating.  ;-)<p>

K) Wolf <p>

Significant benefits to perception and willpower.  The willpower is good for 
wizards and mindcrafters, of course.  Races that start with lower perception 
include dwarves, orcs and of course trolls.<p>

L) Tree <p>

Made for mindcrafters, who really need that +5 to willpower in the early game.  
Not bad for wizards either.<p>
